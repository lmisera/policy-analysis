Analysis of Nuclear-Relevant Legislative Text

I. Key Nuclear Policy Changes

The legislative text includes several significant nuclear policy changes. The most notable is the acceleration of development of small, portable modular nuclear reactors for military use. This policy change reflects a growing interest in the potential of small modular reactors (SMRs) to provide flexible, scalable, and potentially more secure power generation for military applications.

II. Modifications of Zero-Emission Nuclear Power Production Credit

The legislative text includes a modification of the zero-emission nuclear power production credit. This modification restricts the credit to taxpayers who are not specified foreign entities or foreign-influenced entities. This change will likely impact the financial viability of nuclear projects involving foreign entities and could potentially influence the structure of future international collaborations in the nuclear sector.

III. Funding Amounts or Incentives for Nuclear

The legislative text appropriates significant funding for various nuclear-related activities. This includes $125 million for the acceleration of development of small, portable modular nuclear reactors for military use, and a total of $10.5 billion for various activities related to nuclear forces, including risk reduction activities for the Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile program, expansion of production capacity of Bâ€“21 long-range bomber aircraft, improvements to the Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile system, and acceleration of the development of Trident D5LE2 submarine-launched ballistic missiles, among others.

IV. Regulatory Changes or NRC-Related Provisions

The legislative text includes a provision that modifies the definition of "advanced nuclear facility" for the purposes of the zero-emission nuclear power production credit. The new definition includes any nuclear facility the reactor design for which is approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

V. Support for Advanced Reactors or Fuel Cycle

The legislative text includes provisions that support the advancement of nuclear power, including employment related to advanced nuclear facilities, advanced nuclear power research and development, nuclear fuel cycle research, development, or production, and the manufacturing or assembly of components used in an advanced nuclear facility.

VI. Interaction with Hydrogen, Geothermal, or Grid Programs

The legislative text includes a provision that adds income from advanced nuclear facilities to the qualifying income of certain publicly traded partnerships. This provision, which also includes income from hydrogen storage, carbon capture, hydropower, and geothermal energy, suggests a recognition of the potential role of advanced nuclear power in a diversified and decarbonized energy mix.
